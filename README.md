# Legal-Service-Delivery-and-Support-for-the-DAO-Ecosystem

The Distributed Autonomous Organization (DAO) development community seeks to decentralize decision making and reduce the imposition of nonconsensual constraints to the greatest extent possible. 

In contrast, the worldâ€™s legal systems and the enforcement of their decisions represents a highly centralized approach to making agreements and resolving disputes that arise from them.

This scoping proposal will propose a legal support infrastructure for DAOs - to help DAOs deal with real world legal needs

The study and report will review the purposes to be served by a centralized legal system and how to achieve the same outcomes through decentralized decision making and problem solving.

In particular, this scoping grant will outline the uses and benefits of the following three legal DAOs: 
1. Legal system reform DAO (broader VA pool with many different expertises similar to DxD), 
2. Arbitration of Smart Contracts dispute DAO (chapter 7.2 of the original paper by Kaal and Calcaterra) - this is a services DAO to the DxD and requires the onboarding of arbitrators who understand problems with smart contracts, 
3. Jurisdictional Legal Wrapper DAO and legal support DAO for Ecosystem DAOs - This is also a services DAO to DxD and will include Crypto attorneys in different jurisdictions who can help set up legal wrappers for DAOs around the world.

The report will address the following content:
